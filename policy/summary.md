## Current contract work structure for Sebastian Sanchez (payments from Vipul)

### Timelines wiki

* Current payment for timelines wiki includes a stipend component
  (hourly pay of $5/hour as of January 2023; increased from $4/hour until
  December 2022) and a component payment per timeline, that is decided
  after the fact loosely based on some
  [guidelines](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/new-timelines-and-updates.mediawiki).

* The current cap on hours per month eligible for stipend is 75 hours;
  for more on the history of the hourly cap, see
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/sebastian-sanchez-timelines-wiki-contract-work-reduction-proposal.md).

* If Sebastian works extra hours beyond the 75 hours, the extra time
  can be recorded as overage. Sebastian can accumulate up to 225 hours
  of overage. Overage can be used in later months when Sebastian works
  less than 75 hours. For instance, if Sebastian has an overage of 30
  hours from past months and works 65 hours in a month, he can use the
  remaining 75 - 65 = 10 hours of overage in the month and get paid
  for a full 75 hours that month. His overage for future months is
  reduced to 30 - 10 = 20 hours.

* Within that hourly cap, there is some [priority
  work](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Vipul)
  with target dates of completion, and beyond that Sebastian has
  considerable freedom to work on whatever timelines he sees fit from
  various lists of suggestions. More information is available on
  Sebastian's [user
  page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian).

* Until December 2023, Sebastian can spend up to 50 hours per month
  on AI-related timelines that is exempt from the 75-hour
  limit. Sebastian can also use part of the 75-hour limit toward
  AI-related timelines. For instance, Sebastian could work 60 hours on
  AI-related timelines and 65 hours on other timelines; 50 of the 60
  hours on AI-related timelines will be considered exempt, and the
  remaining 10 hours on AI-related timelines plus the other 65 hours
  will together use up the 75 hours.

  We'll re-evaluate by the end of December 2023 whether to continue
  the 50 exempt hours for AI-related timelines to future months.

* Vipul and Sebastian may mutually decide to waive or increase the
  hours limit in a particular month. Possible reasons: there is a lot
  of time-sensitive work to be completed that month, or Sebastian
  worked less in a previous month (a reverse overage).

* All of Sebastian's work (including ongoing work that is not yet
  completed) can be found
  [here](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sebastian).

* Completed work with finalized payments can be accessed
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary that includes pending payments and is
  sometimes a little bit ahead is
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki).

### Org Watch

* For Org Watch, the first 40 hours each month are paid at a rate of
  $9/hour; after that, each hour is paid at $5/hour.

* In addition, all Org Watch work is eligible for the $5/hour stipend.

* You can access all of Sebastian's commits on Org Watch
  [here](https://github.com/riceissa/aiwatch/commits/sebastian).

* Org Watch payments are recorded and updated monthly
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary is
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki).

* NOTE: Time spent learning SQL as an investment to help become better
  with the SQL parts of Org Watch should *not* be counted as Org Watch
  time, but should be counted as stipend-eligible time. So this time
  will be eligible only for the $5/hour stipend, but not for the Org
  Watch pay of $9/hour or $5/hour, and the hours will not count toward
  the 40-hour limit for the $9/hour Org Watch rate.

* Temporary increase from September to December 2023: Instead of the
  first 40 hours, the first 50 hours each month at a rate of $9/hour;
  after that, each hour is paid at $5/hour.

### Subject wikis (subwiki)

We have been in discussions around possibly starting paid work on
subwiki, but as of October 29, 2023, there is no ongoing agreement to
support such work.

### Update process for payments due

Vipul enters payments due to Sebastian at a monthly frequency, with
payments accrued within a given month entered together usually within
the first 15 days of the next month. The update generally takes the
form of a single commit to the contractwork repo that triggers updates
[here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez)
and
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki). Below
are some more details about the various pieces of the update:

* Completed new timelines and expansions: Sebastian may report the
  completion of new timelines and expansions on the [Ready for review
  section of his user
  page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Ready_for_review)
  on an ongoing basis. Vipul may review the completed timelines and
  do one of these:

  * Return with feedback (moving the timeline to the [Returned with
    feedback section of the user
    page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Returned_with_feedback)
    with either inlined feedback or a link to feedback on the talk
    page of the submitted timeline.

  * Add tentative pending pay for the timeline
    [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki#Tentative_pending_payments). Sebastian
    has the option to accept the tentative pending pay or raise any
    concerns. If Sebastian accepts the tentative pending pay, that
    section is updated to reflect acceptance, but it still remains
    tentative until the end-of-month update. Sebastian may record the
    acceptance of the tentative pending pay on his user page, while
    still keeping the timeline in the Ready for review list.

  During the end-of-month update, all timelines with tentative pending
  pay have their pay "finalized" and formally entered in the
  contractwork data. After this, Sebastian clears the timelines from
  the Ready for review list.

* Hours spent: Within a few days of the end of the month, Sebastian
  reports hours spent broken down by: Org Watch, Timelines wiki (with
  a breakdown for AI-related timelines for the period where these
  timelines have a special hours exemption), and tech
  learning. Separately, Sebastian also reports hours spent on
  timelines for the Future Fund Regranting Program, which is the
  subject of the next section. All this information is incporporated
  by Vipul as part of his monthly update for the calculation of
  stipend money as well as additional Org Watch hourly payment.

### Process and criteria for making payments

Vipul generally makes payments to Sebastian when the balance is less
than $1,500, i.e., Sebastian has less than $1,500 worth of work to do
for Vipul to fully earn the amount paid out so far by Vipul. Since the
balance is only updated as part of the monthly update or when a
payment is made, this means that the detection of balance being less
than $1,500 may be delayed by about a month from when it actually
drops to below $1,500.

After it is decided that a payment should be made, the amount and
modality are discussed between Vipul and Sebastian, and payment is
coordinated. The amount should be enough to support at least two
months and not more than six months of contract work at current
rates. As of 2023, the payment method is Bitcoin.

### Update process for payments due

Vipul enters payments due for Future Fund Regranting Program along
with entering payments due for him. The process for individual
timelines is very similar to the process for indiividual timelines for
Vipul, except that there is a "multiplier" in payment determination
and also, in some cases, Vipul may consult with Pablo Stafforini
before making the payment.

Future Fund Regranting Program payments due information is available
at the same links
[here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez)
and
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki). However,
there's also a dedicated page
[here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Future+Fund+Regranting+Program)
for just the Future Fund Regranting Program data.

Vipul generally sends an email to Pablo Stafforini with a summary
after doing the monthly update. The summary includes the updates since
the last summary sent. Vipul may skip sending summaries in months
where there hasn't been significant work on Future Fund Regranting
Program timelines.

### There are no further payments

The Future Fund Regranting Program no longer exists, so there are no
further payments being made. Once the previously made payments are
used up, work funded by these payments will stop.

## Other support for the work of Sebastian Sanchez

### Timelines wiki

The Future Fund Regranting Program is funding some timelines by
Sebastian. You can see
https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Future+Fund+Regranting+Program
for more detail on the work funded by Future Fund Regranting Program,
and
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Future_Fund_Regranting_Program_.28list_from_Pablo_Stafforini.29
for a list of in-progress and future work. This pays a $4/hour stipend
and additionally pays for specific timelines at specified multiples of
what Vipul would pay.

There is no hourly cap; however, in general Sebastian is expected to
spend up to 75 hours per month on these timelines as he spends the
rest of his time doing work for Vipul Naik.

As of October 29, 2023, the priority of work is as follows:

* Aim to finish all timelines that were 75%+ complete as of May 13,
  2023, picking them one by one.

* After that, focus first on AI-related timelines within Future Fund
  work.

### Org Watch

We have been in discussions around potential outside support for a subset of
work on Org Watch, but as of October 29, 2023, there is no public
information about this.

Relevant information will likely be made public before any actual work
covered by such outside support is paid for.

## Current contract work structure for Issa Rice (payments from Vipul)

### Rates

These rates are all on top of the monthly stipend of $11/hour up to
120 hours per month (increased starting January 2023 with a 20%
inflation adjustment; the original rate was $9/hour from December 2019
to December 2022, with a cap of 150 hours per month).

### Update process for payments due

Payments due to Issa are updated monthly. For each month, Issa submits
to Vipul his own calculation of the time spent in various projects,
the rates used, and the total amount he is due; he also includes a
calculation of the stipend and an overall total. Vipul uses this as
raw material when entering the data in the contractwork repo, and
discusses with Issa if there are any discrepancies or anomalies. In
most cases, there are no anomalies; when there are anomalies they tend
to be small, on the order of a dollar.

The information is available
[here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice)
and
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/issa-list.mediawiki).

Payments for some ongoing tasks is annual: as of 2023, this includes
domain renewals and maintenance work for Timelines wiki.

Allowed lags:

* Lag of up to 90 days from the end of the month for Issa to submit
  information for the month; in some cases, when the amount of work in
  a month was small, Issa bunches it up with later months to save on
  switching costs.

* Lag of up to 15 days from when Issa submits information to when
  Vipul enters it in the contractwork repo.

### Process and criteria for making payments

After each monthly update, Vipul checks the balance due from Vipul to
Issa. If this balance exceeds $300, then after checking with Issa,
Vipul clears out the balance via PayPal.

Note that unlike the case of Sebastian, where the balance due is
generally negative, the balance due to Issa is generally positive or
zero, and it's zero only right after the balance is cleared.

Since the balance due stays positive, Issa may request the balance to
be cleared at any time. If there is a past month for which Issa has
already submitted data that Vipul has not yet entered, then the
submitted data by Issa may be used when requesting payment. If Issa
would like to include payments accrued in the current month for
balance-clearing, Issa should submit the relevant calculations as part
of the balance request.

Allowed lags:

* Lag of up to 7 days from the time a balance of $300 or more is
  detected and when it gets cleared.

* Lag of up to 15 days from the time Issa requests balance-clearing
  (for balances under $300 or for cases where the balance includes
  data that has not yet been officially entered into the contractwork
  repo) to the time it gets cleared.
