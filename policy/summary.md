## Current contract work structure for Sebastian Sanchez (payments from Vipul)

### Timelines wiki

* Current payment for timelines wiki includes a stipend component
  (hourly pay of $5/hour as of January 2023; increased from $4/hour until
  December 2022) and a component payment per timeline, that is decided
  after the fact loosely based on some
  [guidelines](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/new-timelines-and-updates.mediawiki).

* The current cap on hours per month eligible for stipend is 75 hours;
  for more on the history of the hourly cap, see
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/sebastian-sanchez-timelines-wiki-contract-work-reduction-proposal.md).

* If Sebastian works extra hours beyond the 75 hours, the extra time
  can be recorded as overage. Sebastian can accumulate up to 225 hours
  of overage. Overage can be used in later months when Sebastian works
  less than 75 hours. For instance, if Sebastian has an overage of 30
  hours from past months and works 65 hours in a month, he can use the
  remaining 75 - 65 = 10 hours of overage in the month and get paid
  for a full 75 hours that month. His overage for future months is
  reduced to 30 - 10 = 20 hours.

* Within that hourly cap, there is some [priority
  work](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Vipul)
  with target dates of completion, and beyond that Sebastian has
  considerable freedom to work on whatever timelines he sees fit from
  various lists of suggestions. More information is available on
  Sebastian's [user
  page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian).

* Until September 2023, Sebastian can spend up to 50 hours per month
  on AI-related timelines that is exempt from the 75-hour
  limit. Sebastian can also use part of the 75-hour limit toward
  AI-related timelines. For instance, Sebastian could work 60 hours on
  AI-related timelines and 65 hours on other timelines; 50 of the 60
  hours on AI-related timelines will be considered exempt, and the
  remaining 10 hours on AI-related timelines plus the other 65 hours
  will together use up the 75 hours.

  We'll re-evaluate by the end of September 2023 whether to continue
  the 50 exempt hours for AI-related timelines to future months.

* Vipul and Sebastian may mutually decide to waive or increase the
  hours limit in a particular month. Possible reasons: there is a lot
  of time-sensitive work to be completed that month, or Sebastian
  worked less in a previous month (a reverse overage).

* All of Sebastian's work (including ongoing work that is not yet
  completed) can be found
  [here](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sebastian).

* Completed work with finalized payments can be accessed
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary that includes pending payments and is
  sometimes a little bit ahead is
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki).

### Org Watch

* For Org Watch, the first 40 hours each month are paid at a rate of
  $9/hour; after that, each hour is paid at $5/hour.

* In addition, all Org Watch work is eligible for the $5/hour stipend.

* You can access all of Sebastian's commits on Org Watch
  [here](https://github.com/riceissa/aiwatch/commits/sebastian).

* Org Watch payments are recorded and updated monthly
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary is
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki).

* NOTE: Time spent learning SQL as an investment to help become better
  with the SQL parts of Org Watch should *not* be counted as Org Watch
  time, but should be counted as stipend-eligible time. So this time
  will be eligible only for the $5/hour stipend, but not for the Org
  Watch pay of $9/hour or $5/hour, and the hours will not count toward
  the 40-hour limit for the $9/hour Org Watch rate.

### Subject wikis (subwiki)

We have been in discussions around possibly starting paid work on
subwiki, but as of May 13, 2023, there is no ongoing agreement to
support such work.

## Other support for the work of Sebastian Sanchez

### Timelines wiki

The Future Fund Regranting Program is funding some timelines by
Sebastian. You can see
https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Future+Fund+Regranting+Program
for more detail on the work funded by Future Fund Regranting Program,
and
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Future_Fund_Regranting_Program_.28list_from_Pablo_Stafforini.29
for a list of in-progress and future work. This pays a $4/hour stipend
and additionally pays for specific timelines at specified multiples of
what Vipul would pay.

There is no hourly cap; however, in general Sebastian is expected to
spend up to 75 hours per month on these timelines as he spends the
rest of his time doing work for Vipul Naik.

As of May 13, 2023, the priority of work is as follows:

* Aim to finish all timelines that were 75%+ complete as of May 13,
  2023, picking them one by one.

* After that, focus first on AI-related timelines within Future Fund
  work.

### Org Watch

We have been in discussions around potential outside support for a subset of
work on Org Watch, but as of May 13, 2023, there is no public
information about this.

Relevant information will likely be made public before any actual work
covered by such outside support is paid for.
