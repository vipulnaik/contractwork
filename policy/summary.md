## Current contract work structure for Sebastian Sanchez (payments from Vipul)

### Timelines wiki

* Current payment for timelines wiki includes a stipend component
  (hourly pay of $4/hour) and a component payment per timeline, that
  is decided after the fact loosely based on some
  [guidelines](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/new-timelines-and-updates.mediawiki).

* We currently have an hourly cap per month for stipend pay, that is
  currently at 150 hours and is set to go down to 75 hours; see
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/sebastian-sanchez-timelines-wiki-contract-work-reduction-proposal.md#transition-phase).

* Within that hourly cap, there is some [priority
  work](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Vipul)
  with target dates of completion, and beyond that Sebastian has
  considerable freedom to work on whatever timelines he sees fit from
  various lists of suggestions. More information is available on
  Sebastian's [user
  page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian).

* All of Sebastian's work (including ongoing work that is not yet
  completed) can be found
  [here](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sebastian).

* Completed work with finalized payments can be accessed
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary that includes pending payments and is
  sometimes a little bit ahead is
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/contributor-lists/sebastian-sanchez-list.mediawiki).

### Org Watch

* For Org Watch, the first 25 hours each month are paid at a rate of
  $9/hour; after that, each hour is paid at $5/hour.

* In addition, all Org Watch work is eligible for the $4/hour stipend.

* You can access all of Sebastian's commits on Org Watch
  [here](https://github.com/riceissa/aiwatch/commits/sebastian).

* Org Watch payments are recorded and updated monthly [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);

### Subject wikis (subwiki)

We are in discussions around possibly starting paid work on subwiki,
but as of June 2022 there is no ongoing agreement to support such
work.

### Timelines wiki

We are in discussions around potential outside support for a subset of
work on Timelines wiki, but as of June 9, 2022, there is no public
information about this.

Relevant information will likely be made public before any actual work
covered by such outside support is paid for.

### Org Watch

We are in discussions around potential outside support for a subset of
work on Org Watch, but as of June 9, 2022, there is no public
information about this.

covered by such outside support is paid for.
