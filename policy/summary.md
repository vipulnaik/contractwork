## Current contract work structure for Sebastian Sanchez (payments from Vipul)

### Timelines wiki

* Current payment for timelines wiki includes a stipend component
  (hourly pay of $5/hour as of January 2023; increased from $4/hour until
  December 2022) and a component payment per timeline, that is decided
  after the fact loosely based on some
  [guidelines](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/new-timelines-and-updates.mediawiki).

* The current cap on hours per month eligible for stipend is 75 hours;
  for more on the history of the hourly cap, see
  [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/contractwork/blob/master/policy/sebastian-sanchez-timelines-wiki-contract-work-reduction-proposal.md). There
  is some scope for additional hours in one month to be used up to
  cover fewer hours in later months, as described in more detail in
  that document.

* Within that hourly cap, there is some [priority
  work](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Vipul)
  with target dates of completion, and beyond that Sebastian has
  considerable freedom to work on whatever timelines he sees fit from
  various lists of suggestions. More information is available on
  Sebastian's [user
  page](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian).

* All of Sebastian's work (including ongoing work that is not yet
  completed) can be found
  [here](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Sebastian).

* Completed work with finalized payments can be accessed
  [here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez);
  a human-readable summary that includes pending payments and is
  sometimes a little bit ahead is

### Org Watch

* For Org Watch, the first 40 hours each month are paid at a rate of
  $9/hour; after that, each hour is paid at $5/hour.

* In addition, all Org Watch work is eligible for the $5/hour stipend.

* You can access all of Sebastian's commits on Org Watch
  [here](https://github.com/riceissa/aiwatch/commits/sebastian).

### Subject wikis (subwiki)

We have been in discussions around possibly starting paid work on
subwiki, but as of January 17, 2023, there is no ongoing agreement to
support such work.

## Other support for the work of Sebastian Sanchez

### Timelines wiki

The Future Fund Regranting Program is funding some timelines by
Sebastian. You can see
https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Future+Fund+Regranting+Program
for more detail on the work funded by Future Fund Regranting Program,
and
https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/User:Sebastian#Priority_work_from_Future_Fund_Regranting_Program_.28list_from_Pablo_Stafforini.29
for a list of in-progress and future work. This pays a $4/hour stipend
and additionally pays for specific timelines at specified multiples of
what Vipul would pay.

### Org Watch

We have been in discussions around potential outside support for a subset of
work on Org Watch, but as of January 17, 2023, there is no public
information about this.

Relevant information will likely be made public before any actual work
covered by such outside support is paid for.
