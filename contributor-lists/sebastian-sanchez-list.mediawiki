=== Stipends ===

Total so far: $8571

The rule of thumb for stipend is: $4/hour if all hours were spent on Timelines wiki, and more if some hours were spent outside (depending on the mix of work). Cap of $800/month, above which additional pay will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

* January: $720. Worked 180 hours on Timelines wiki.

* February: $712. Worked 178 hours, including 170 on Timelines wiki and 8 on Machinelearning subwiki.

* March: $830. Worked 212 hours, including 195 on Timelines wiki, 16 on Machinelearning subwiki, and 1 on reviewing a wikiHow article.

* April: $806. The payment is at $4/hour for all hours, plus an additional $6/hour for 9 hours for which the output is not directly compensated. Worked 188 hours, including 177 on Timelines wiki, 1 on Machinelearning subwiki, and 1 on reviewing a wikiHow article.

* May: $808. The payment is at $4/hour for all hours, plus an additional $5/hour for 20 hours for which the output is not directly compensated. Worked 177 hours, including 157 on Timelines wiki.

* June: $735. The payment is at $4/hour for all hours, plus an additional $5/hour for 15 hours for which the output is not directly compensated. Worked 165 hours, including 150 on Timelines wiki.

* July: $740. The payment is at $4/hour for all hours, plus an additional $5/hour for 12 hours for which output is not directly compensated. Worked 170 hours, including 130 on Timelines wiki and 28 on Org Watch.

* August: $612. The payment is at $4/hour for all 153 hours eligible for stipend. Total time spent was as follows: 139 hours on Timelines wiki, 24 hours on Org Watch, and 9 hours on other activities. For Timelines wiki, the number of hours was in excess of the cap of 120 hours, so only the first 120 hours were eligible for stipend.

* September: $700. The payment is at $4/hour for all 160 hours eligible for stipend, plus 15 of 19 excess hours accumulated from last month. Total time spent was follows: 105 hours on Timelines wiki, 17 hours on Timelines wiki promotion, 38 hours on Org Watch, and 15 hours overage on Timelines wiki applied from the previous month. The reason only 15 hours rather than the full 19 hours of the past overage were applied is that with 15 hours, we already hit the cap of 120 hours on Timelines wiki for September.

* October: $688. The payment is at $4/hour for all 172 hours eligible for stipend. Total time spent was as follows: 126 hours on Timelines wiki, 8 hours on Timelines wiki promotion, and 44 hours on Org Watch. For Timelines wiki, the number of hours was in excess of the cap of 120 hours, so only the first 120 hours were eligible for stipend. As of now, we have a total overage of 10 hours on Timelines wiki (4 hours carried over, and 6 more hours this month).

* November: $564. The payment is at $4/hour for all 131 hours eligible for stipend, plus all 10 excess hours accumulated from earlier.  Total time spent was as follows: 98.5 hours on Timelines wiki, 1.5 hours on Timelines wiki SEO research, and 31 hours on Org Watch.
