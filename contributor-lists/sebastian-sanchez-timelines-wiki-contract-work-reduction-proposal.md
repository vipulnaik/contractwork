# Sebastian Sanchez: Timelines Wiki contract work reduction proposal

## Steady state of proposal

### Impact on Timelines Wiki work

In steady state, stipend-eligible work on Timelines Wiki will be
capped to 75 hours per month at $4/hour, with the following caveats:

* Sebastian is free to work a larger number of hours and get paid for
  tasks, just without the stipend. There will be no discrimination in
  adding task payments just because the work was done outside of
  stipend hours.

* Sebastian can accumulate overage of up to 225 hours that can then be
  used up in later months when he works less than the 75 hours
  limit. For instance, if he works 125 hours each month on Timelines
  Wiki for three months in a row, he accumulated an overage of 3 *
  (125 - 75) = 150 hours, which is less than the maximum of 240 hours
  that can be accumulated. If in the fourth month he works just 5
  hours on Timelines Wiki, he can use up 70 of those 150 hours (for a
  total of the cap of 75 hours in that month), leaving an accumulated
  overage of 80 hours. The accumulated overage at a given time cannot
  exceed 225 hours. However, overages across the years may add up to
  more than that; they just need to be used up in order to free space
  for more overages.

* If Sebastian's work for Vipul stops completely, Vipul will pay out
  the accumulated overage at 75 hours per month (over at most the next
  3 months), though we may speed up the payout to close the books more
  quickly.

* Vipul and Sebastian may mutually decide to waive or increase the
  hours limit in a particular month. Possible reasons: there is a lot
  of time-sensitive work to be completed that month, or Sebastian
  worked less in a previous month (a reverse overage).

### Impact on priority work assigned for Timelines Wiki

Vipul expects that, after the reduction in hours for Timelines Wiki
contract work, priority work will take up between 50% and 75% of the
stipend hours for Timelines Wiki. Thus, this is expected to be 37.5
hours to 56 hours per month. Therefore, the total amount of priority
work will not reduce too much (the current target is for priority work
to take up about 30% of ~195 hours spent on Timelines Wiki per
month). Most of the reduction will be in hours spent on other
timelines that are lower-priority from Vipul's perspective.

### Impact on other kinds of work

Other kinds of work will be subject to the usual stipend rates, and no
explicit cap on hours for the time being, with the following caveats:

* The default stipend rate for all other kinds of work is $4/hour up
  to (200 hours - number of stipend hours on Timelines Wiki). After
  that, the rate may reduce somewhat.

* A higher stipend rate may be used if the work is not paid for
  separately (i.e., stipend is the only form of compensation).

## Transition phase

The proposed transition phase is to reduce the number of hours of
stipend-eligible work on Timelines Wiki by 20 hours per month each
month, starting from the current level of about 200 hours. Explicitly:

* May: 165 hours
* June: 150 hours
* July: 135 hours
* August: 120 hours
* September: 105 hours
* October: 90 hours
* November: 75 hours

Overages can be accumulated even during the transition phase; the
overage accumulated from a given month will be calculated against the
limit set for that month. For instance, if Sebastian works 165 hours
in June on Timelines Wiki, he will be paid for 160 hours and
accumulate an overage of (165 - 150) = 15 hours. If in July he works
120 or fewer hours, he can use those 15 hours and still stay within
the July limit of 135 hours.

## Continued monitoring and tweaks

### Month-to-month monitoring

Both Vipul and Sebastian will monitor the impact of this reduced
number of hours on both Timelines Wiki output and output in other
areas. The hour limit for a particular month may be reduced by Vipul
and communicated to Sebastian by the 15th of the previous
month. Increases may, however, be done later or even during the month.

### Potential long-term trajectory changes

Vipul expects that the reduction to 75 hours will likely last from
November 2020 till around April 2021, after which Vipul will make a
decision with Sebastian as to how to further modify the number of
hours. There is a good chance that stipend for Timelines Wiki work
will be further reduced to about 30 hours by late 2021. Most likely, such
a reduction will be done in a phased manner, with the limit going down
every month by at most 15 hours per month. It is, however, also
possible that the hour limit will be increased after April 2021, or
that there will be more months where the hour limit is lifted.

Factors that will affect which way we go include:

* Vipul's income and financial situation
* Traction of Timelines Wiki (pageviews, reputation)
* Vipul's personal interest in the continued expansion of Timelines
  Wiki, as well as specific timelines (for instance, if Vipul finds
  that there is frequent need for priority work on timelines that does
  not fit within the 75-hour limit, he may increase the limit)
* Availability of other co-funders (for instance, Vipul may be
  interested in increasing stipend hours if the work itself is paid
  for by other funders)
* Progress on and cost-effectiveness of other projects that either
  Sebastian can do or Vipul can fund through other channels

## Potential impact on work

### Case that Sebastian continues work on Timelines Wiki at current levels

In this case, Sebastian will be forgoing stipend, but otherwise things
will look very similar to what they are right now. This will cause
Sebastian's monthly income to fall by around USD 400 to USD 500 though
the drop will be gradual over the next few months.

### Case that Sebastian reduces work on Timelines Wiki and ramps up work on subwiki and other projects

In this case, Sebastian's stipend should remain close to the same. The
effect on task payments isn't clear, as it will depend on the
(yet-to-be-determined) pay rates for the tasks and how valuable Vipul
finds the output.

### Case that we find third parties to cover cost + stipend for some timelines

In this case, Sebastian may not reduce Timelines Wiki work all the way
to 75 hours per month, even though he reduces Timelines Wiki work for
Vipul to around that much. Instead, he'll spend his remaining
Timelines Wiki work preparing timelines requested by third parties.
