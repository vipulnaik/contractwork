=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===

For each month, the payment is calculated according to:

max{$27, min{$50, 5 * (1 + ''N'')}}

Here, ''N'' is supposed to represent number of new distinct grants. This is calculated as follows: at the end of each month, take the union of "all grants newly announced to the public by Open Phil during that month" and "all grants newly announced to the public by Good Ventures during that month". Then ''N'' is the number of grants in this set. Note that because Open Phil and Good Ventures do not immediately add grants to their databases as soon as they are made, the grants newly announced to the public during a month likely differ from the grants made during the same month.

Total so far: $100

=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===

For each month, the payment is calculated according to:

max{$27, min{$50, 5 * (1 + ''N'')}}

Here, ''N'' is supposed to represent number of new distinct grants. This is calculated as follows: at the end of each month, take the union of "all grants newly announced to the public by Open Phil during that month" and "all grants newly announced to the public by Good Ventures during that month". Then ''N'' is the number of grants in this set. Note that because Open Phil and Good Ventures do not immediately add grants to their databases as soon as they are made, the grants newly announced to the public during a month likely differ from the grants made during the same month.

Total so far: $417
