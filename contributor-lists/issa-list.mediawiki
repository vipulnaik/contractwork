=== Tasks for Peter Hurford ===

Total so far: $645

* [https://gist.github.com/riceissa/186b1d2e8bbb85e6204b5e06aba64018 hits-based giving project]: $570. Initial work on a project based on a slight modification of an earlier [http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14s/how_many_hits_does_hitsbased_giving_get_a/ proposal by Peter Hurford]. The project couldn't work out due to data not being available; however, Issa was paid $15/hour for 38 hours.

* [https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project#donorDonationAmountsByDisclosuresAndYear Breakdown of Open Phil donations by disclosure and year, also works with any cause area filter]: $75.

=== Royalties ===

Total so far: $41

* Cause Prioritization Wiki (January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2017): $41

=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===

For each month, the payment is calculated according to:

max{$27, min{$50, 5 * (1 + ''N'')}}

Here, ''N'' is supposed to represent number of new distinct grants. This is calculated as follows: at the end of each month, take the union of "all grants newly announced to the public by Open Phil during that month" and "all grants newly announced to the public by Good Ventures during that month". Then ''N'' is the number of grants in this set. Note that because Open Phil and Good Ventures do not immediately add grants to their databases as soon as they are made, the grants newly announced to the public during a month likely differ from the grants made during the same month.

Total so far: $100

* January end update of Open Phil and GV grants database: $50 (for adding 6 new grants to Open Phil and 13 new grants to Good Ventures). Completed January 29, 2017.

This included some work for Peter visible at https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project#donorDonationAmountsByDisclosuresAndYear for which a cost of $75 was paid by Peter, so the amount paid here includes total value of work ($400) minus the cost covered by Peter.

=== Open Phil and Good Ventures Wikipedia page grant list updates ===

For each month, the payment is calculated according to:

max{$27, min{$50, 5 * (1 + ''N'')}}

Here, ''N'' is supposed to represent number of new distinct grants. This is calculated as follows: at the end of each month, take the union of "all grants newly announced to the public by Open Phil during that month" and "all grants newly announced to the public by Good Ventures during that month". Then ''N'' is the number of grants in this set. Note that because Open Phil and Good Ventures do not immediately add grants to their databases as soon as they are made, the grants newly announced to the public during a month likely differ from the grants made during the same month.
