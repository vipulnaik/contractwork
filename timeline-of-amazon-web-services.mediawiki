! Time period !! class="unsortable" | Key developments at Amazon Web Services
|-
| 2006–2010 || Amazon Web Services launches both Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon S3, and starts the growth of [[cloud computing]], overwhelmingly dominating the sector in the process. 
|-
| 2011–2015 || AWS is reported to be profitable by 2015, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year, and $265 million of operating income. By then, [[Gartner]] estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers. AWS becomes adopted by the US government, [[Netflix]], and many other Internet services.

|-
| 2000 || || Prelude || [[Amazon.com]], the parent company of the as yet nonexistent AWS, begins work on merchant.com, an e-commerce platform intended for use by other large retailers such as [[Target Corporation]]. In the process, Amazon's team realizes that they need to decouple their code better, with cleaner interfaces and access APIs. Around the same time, the company also realizes the need to build infrastructure-as-a-service internally, to improve the speed of development and not have it bottlenecked by infrastructure availability. All these changes help pave the way for AWS.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/|title = How AWS came to be|date = July 2, 2016|accessdate = December 4, 2016|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''|last = Miller|first = Ron}}</ref><ref name=medium-jassy>{{cite web|url = https://medium.com/@furrier/original-content-the-story-of-aws-and-andy-jassys-trillion-dollar-baby-4e8a35fd7ed#.g4p7t635j|title = Exclusive: The Story of AWS and Andy Jassy’s Trillion Dollar Baby.
