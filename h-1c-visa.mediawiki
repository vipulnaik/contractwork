== History ==
Late in 1999, Congress passed the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act, which calls for the creation of a new H-1C visa for nurses going to work for up to three years in health professional shortage areas. Up to 500 nurses per year can get the visa, but each state is limited to 25 H-1C nurses a year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilw.com/articles/2007,1217-siskind.shtm|title=ILW.COM - immigration news: Immigrant's Weekly: H-1C Visas for Registered Nurses|website=www.ilw.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>. The 1999 law is very similar to a 1989 law that created the H-1A visa for nurses. That visa category expired several years ago after unsuccessful efforts to extend its life. The key differences between the two programs are that a much smaller number of H-1C visas have been allocated and that the facility where the nurse will work must be in a health professional shortage area.

One of the few immigration measures passed in the last Congress was the extension of a little known nurse visa category called the H-1C. In November 2006, Congress approved legislation to extend the H-1C program for three more years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilw.com/articles/2007,1217-siskind.shtm|title=H-1C Visas for Registered Nurses|website=Immigrants Weekly|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref> This classification expired as of December 20, 2009.
