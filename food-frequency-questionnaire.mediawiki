'''Food frequency questionnaire''' ('''FFQ''') is a questionnaire used to obtain frequency and, in some cases, portion size information about food and beverage consumption over a specified period of time, typically the past month or year.<ref name=nci>{{cite web|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/profiles/questionnaire|title = Food Frequency Questionnaire at a Glance|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]]}}</ref> FFQs are a common dietary assessment tool used in large [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] studies of diet and health.<ref name=fh>{{cite web|url=http://sharedresources.fredhutch.org/services/food-frequency-questionnaires-ffq|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = Fred Hutch}}</ref><ref name=ace>{{cite web|url = http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/survey-guidelines/food-frequency-questionnaires/|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|publisher = [[Animal Charity Evaluators]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref> Examples of usage include assessment of intake of [[vitamin]]s and other nutrients,<ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq>{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584829/|title = Reproducibility and validity of a food frequency questionnaire among pregnant women in a Mediterranean area|doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-12-26|last = Vioque|first = Jesús|last2 = Navarrete-Muñoz|first2 = Eva-María|last3 = Gimenez-Monzó|first3 = Daniel|last4 = García-de-la-Hera|first4 = Manuela|last5 = Granado|first5 = Fernando|last6 = Young|first6 = Ian S|last7 = Ramón|first7 = Rosa|last8 = Ballester|first8 = Ferran|last9 = Murcia|first9 = Mario|last10 = Rebagliato|first10 = Marisa|last11 = Iñiguez|first11 = Carmen|journal = [[Nutrition Journal]]|year=2013|volume=12}}</ref><ref name=pregnancy-pufa-ffq>{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367853/|title = The validity of a food frequency questionnaire as a measure of PUFA status in pregnancy|last = Parker|first = Gordon|last2 = McClure|first2 = Georgia|last3 = Hegarty|first3 = Bronwyn|last4 = Smith|first4 = Isabelle Granville|journal = BMC Pregnancy Childbirth|volume = 15|doi = 10.1186/s12884-015-0494-3}}</ref><ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq>{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4709981/|title = Validity and reliability of a food frequency questionnaire to estimate dietary intake among Lebanese children|last = Moghames|first = Patricia|last2 = Hammami|first2 = Nour|last3 = Hwalla|first3 = Nahla|last4 = Shoaib|first4 = Hikma|last5 = Nasreddine|first5 = Lara|last6 = Naja|first6 = Farah|journal = [[Nutrition Journal]]|year = 2015|volume = 15}}</ref> assessment of the intake of toxins,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Smedts HP, de Vries JH, Rakhshandehroo M, etal |title=High maternal vitamin E intake by diet or supplements is associated with congenital heart defects in the offspring |journal=BJOG |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=416–23 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19187374 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01957.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/11/2304 |title=A Prospective Study of Dietary Acrylamide Intake and the Risk of Endometrial, Ovarian, and Breast Cancer |publisher=Cebp.aacrjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> and estimating the prevalence of dietary patterns such as [[vegetarianism]].<ref name=ace/> It is an example of a [[dietary assessment]] tool.

==Structure and data collected==

=== Questions ===

A FFQ includes questions on a set of food and beverage items. For each food or beverage item, there may be questions asking about the following:<ref name=nci/><ref name=nhanes-en>{{cite web|url = http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/archive/usualintakes/FFQ.English.June0304.pdf|title = NHANES Food Questionnaire|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref>

* Frequency of consumption (with a "never" option as well as options ranging from very infrequent to several times a day).<ref name=nhanes-en/>
* Portion size information, which may be framed in terms of portion size for each round of consumption or total portion size. Respondents may be asked to translate usual consumption amount to number of specified units, such as a cup of rice. Some questionnaires include portion size images (such as photographs) in an attempt to enhance reporting [[accuracy]].<ref name=nci/><ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/>
* Other information, such as frequency of consumption at particular times of the year, or the subtype or brand that people consume.

In addition to foods and beverages, FFQs often ask about the frequency of intake and dosages of commonly consumed [[dietary supplements]].

=== Length and administration format ===

A FFQ that aims to capture total dietary intake includes questions on 80 to 120 food and beverage items, and takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete.<ref name=nci/>

FFQs may be interviewer-administered in case of low literacy<ref name=nci/> as well as when being conducted on children.<ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/>

FFQs are intended for individual rather than household use (i.e., they need to be answered for each individual food consumer). For very young children, the FFQ may be answered by a parent or guardian instead.

=== Types of FFQs ===

FFQs are classified as:<ref name=D/><ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review>{{cite web|url = https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/scotdietassessmethods.pdf|title = A short review of dietary assessment methods used in National and Scottish Research Studies|last = Wrieden|first = Wendy|last2 = Peace|first2 = Heather|last3 = Armstrong|first3 = Julie|last4 = Barton|first4 = Karen}}</ref>

* Non-quantitative FFQs if they collect only frequency information, and no portion size information, and
* Semi-quantitative FFQs if they collect information on both frequency and portion size.

== Relation with other assessment tools ==

=== Similar diet assessment tools ===

FFQ is a common method for [[dietary assessment]], i.e., for constructing the respondent's [[diet history]]. Some other methods include:<ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/>

* 24-hour diet recall: This is a structured interview intended to capture detailed information about all the foods and beverages consumed by the respondent in the last 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/profiles/recall/|title = 24-hour Dietary Recall (24HR) At a Glance|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://medanth.wikispaces.com/24-hour+diet+recall|title = 24-hour diet recall|publisher = Medanth|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref> For young children, the parent or guardian may respond on the child's behalf.<ref>{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073154/|title = Development and Pilot Testing of 24-Hour Multiple-Pass Recall to Assess Dietary Intake of Toddlers of Somali- and Iraqi-Born Mothers Living in Norway|journal = Nutrients|doi = 10.3390/nu6062333}}</ref> A variant of this method is the multiple-pass recall. Here, after an initial recall, the interviewer goes back to previous questions to clarify further details.<ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/>
* Other kinds of diet history interviews, such as narrative diet histories.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S0002-8223(00)00237-6/abstract|title = Applying Conversation Analysis to Foster Accurate Reporting in the Diet History Interview|last = Tapsell|first = Linda Clare|last2 = Brenninger|first2 = Vanessa|last3 = Barnard|first3 = Janelle}}</ref>
* Weighted food diary (also called weighted food record): The individual records details of food and beverage in the diary at the time of consumption.<ref name=weighted-food-diary>{{cite web|url = http://www.dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/dietary-assessment/methods/weighed-food-diary/indication.php|title = Dietary assessment - Weighed food diary|publisher = Medical Research Council|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref> A variant of this method is estimated food records, where the quantification of food and drink is estimated rather than weighed.<ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/>

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to weighted food records ===

FFQs, as well as other retrospective diet assessment methods (such as the 24-hour diet recall and other diet history methods) have the advantage that they do not directly affect the behavior of the respondent. In contrast, weighted food records may influence the participant's eating behavior. Weighted food records also carry a high respondent burden.<ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/>

One disadvantage of FFQs and other retrospective methods is that they may be less accurate because participants are relying on memory rather than information recorded in real time.

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to the 24-hour diet recall ===

FFQs have the following advantages:

* They can better capture consumption of foods consumed occasionally or episodically than the 24-hour diet recall. For instance, if people habitually consume alcohol more on Fridays, then a 24-hour diet recall conducted on Tuesday will underestimate the extent of alcohol consumption, whereas a well-designed FFQ can capture the information.<ref name=nci/><ref name=D/>
* They are easier to administer to literate populations at large scale and also easier to process than diet recalls.<ref name=D/>

FFQs have many disadvantages:

* Due to the longer time period involved, FFQs are more dependent on people having good memory as well as being able to accurately estimate the frequency of rare events (for instance, being able to correctly judge whether they consume something once a month or once a week). These are cognitively complex tasks that require good generic memory.<ref name=nci/> 
* FFQs lack detailed information on how the food was prepared as well as information on exactly how much was consumed and when. 
* Since FFQs are limited to a fixed list of foods, they may not capture eating patterns of people who have very different eating patterns.<ref name=nci/><ref name=D/> 
* FFQs are more subject (than diet recalls) to [[social desirability bias]], with people over-reporting the extent of consumption of "healthy" foods such as fruits and vegetables.<ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/>

=== Validation of FFQs using other methods ===

Due to some of the concerns surrounding the validity and reliability of FFQs, research using a FFQ generally also tests the validity of the FFQ. In a typical research design, the FFQ is validated against another dietary assessment technique (such as 24-hour diet recall or weighted food records) on a small population.<ref name=nci/><ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/><ref name=pregnancy-pufa-ffq/><ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/><ref name=north-sweden-ffq>{{cite journal|pmid = 12003662|title = Validation and calibration of food-frequency questionnaire measurements in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease cohort|journal = [[Public Health Nutrition]]}}</ref> Once validated, the FFQ can be distributed to a wider population with the same characteristics. The need to validate FFQs against diet recalls or other more reliable methods is a recurrent theme in research and guidance on FFQs.<ref name=nci-principles/>

==Food frequency questionnaires in use==

=== Specificity to populations ===

Since FFQs list specific food and beverage items, a FFQ designed for and validated against one population is not valid for other populations. Therefore, FFQs must be appropriately modified and revalidated against new populations.<ref name=sri-lanka-ffq>{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4766149/|title = Validity of a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutritional intake among Sri Lankan adults|last = Jayawardena|first = Ranil|last2 = Byrne|first2 = Nuala|last3 = Soares|first3 = Mario|last4 = Katulanda|first4 = Prasad|last5 = Hills|first5 = Andrew}}</ref> A few key challenges include:

* Different populations consume different sets of foods and beverages, so the list of items in a FFQ validated against one population may not cover all the items for the other population.
* Even when the items match in name, the methods of preparation may differ significantly enough that results from one FFQ may not be applicable to a different FFQ.
* Different populations use different languages, so the FFQ needs to be translated. Even when populations use the same language (e.g., two English-speaking countries) the jargon for specific food items can differ. Thus, for instance, in order to administer the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ II) in Canada, a Canadian version, C-DHQ-II, was created.<ref name=cdhq2/>

A number of standard FFQs are available for adults in the United States.<ref name=D/> There is also research based on FFQs in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/> although weighted food records are more common there.<ref name=weighted-food-diary/> FFQs have also been developed in [[Sweden]] and other Northern and Western European countries.<ref name=north-sweden-ffq/> There has been some research on FFQs in other regions, such as the Middle East and Mediterranean,<ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/><ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/> [[Sri Lanka]],<ref name=sri-lanka-ffq/> and [[Shanghai]], [[China]].<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v58/n1/full/1601738a.html|pmid = 14679362|title = Validity and reproducibility of the food frequency questionnaire used in the Shanghai Women's Health Study|last = Shu|first = XO|last2 = Yang|first2 = G|last3 = Jin|first3 = F|last4 = Kushi|first4 = L|last5 = Wen|first5 = W|last6 = Gao|first6 = YT|last7 = Zheng|first7 = W|journal = [[European Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|year = 2004|volume = 58|issue = 1|pages = 17-23}}</ref>

== Analysis of data ==

=== Calculation of nutrient intake (for semi-quantitative FFQs) ===

Calculations for nutrient intake can be estimated via computerized [[software]] programs that multiply the reported frequency of each food by the amount of nutrient in a serving of that food. References databases commonly used for this purpose are listed below. Note that to estimate total nutrient intake, it is necessary to include dietary supplements in the FFQ and add the nutrient intake from these, particularly when dealing with populations where the consumption of dietary supplements is common.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/learn/questionnaire-screeners.html|title=Food Composition Databases for Food Frequency Questionnaires and Screeners}}</ref>

* The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), which in turn is based on the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]]. To incorporate the effect of dietary supplements, the USDA Dietary Supplement Integrated Database (DSID) can be used.<ref name=usda-fnd-infra>{{Cite web|url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/JN_FoodNutrDB.pdf|title = USDA Food and Nutrient Databases Provide the Infrastructure for Food and Nutrient Research, Policy, and Practice|last = Ahuja|first = Jaspreet|last2 = Moshfegh|first2 = Alanna|last3 = Holden|first3 = Joanne|last4 = Harris|first4 = Ellen}}</ref>
* The [[University of Minnesota]] Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC)'s Food and Nutrient Database.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ncc.umn.edu/food-and-nutrient-database/|title = Food and Nutrient Database|publisher = [[Nutrition Coordinating Center]], [[University of Minnesota]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}</ref>

For non-quantitative FFQs, nutrient intake cannot be calculated as accurately, but the FFQ can still be used to get a rough idea of nutrient consumption.<ref name=nci/>

=== Calculation of food groups consumed ===

A related use of FFQs is to determine how much people consume broad groups of foods. Examples of such food groups are fruits, vegetables, and added sugars. A useful database for this purpose is the USDA's Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED).<ref name=usda-fnd-infra/>

=== Comparison data ===

In the [[United States]], data from NHANES is used to provide nationwide comparison data.<ref name=D>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/ctrc/Nutrition/Documents/Food_Frequency_Questionnaires.pdf|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[University of Colorado Denver]]}}</ref>

=== Population-level analyses ===

FFQs can be used for a variety of population-level analyses:

* Estimation of total consumption of specific foods, food groups, and nutrients in a population.
* Estimation of the correlation between patterns of food consumption and other non-diet variables, such as health status or specific medical conditions.
* Estimation of the effectiveness of interventions to change diet. In this experimental design, both the experiment subjects and the control group are asked to fill in the FFQ before and after the intervention, and changes in food consumption patterns for the experimental group are measured. However, because of concern about potential [[differential response]] bias due to the tendency of the intervention group to misreport their diets to a greater extent than the control group, use of an FFQ (or any self-report dietary instrument) as the sole evaluation method should be carefully considered.<ref name=nci/>

== Criticism ==

The low validity of FFQs has made them a subject of criticism. Walter Willett, developer of the Harvard FFQ, estimated a correlation of 0.60 to 0.70 between standard FFQs and diet recalls.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1100.full|last=Willett|first=Walter|authorlink = Walter Willett|title=Invited Commentary: A Further Look at Dietary Questionnaire Validation|journal = [[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|volume = 154|issue = 12|pages=1100-1102}}</ref>

Alan R. Kristal, Ulrike Peters and John D. Potter wrote in their article "Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?" that there was not much scope to learn more from FFQs, and that a more curious and exploratory approach was needed to uncover new insights on diet and its correlation with health status.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/12/2826.short|last = Kristal|first = Alan R.|last2 = Peters|first2 = Ulrike|last3 = Potter|first3 = John D.|title=Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?|doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-ED1|publisher = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention|year = 2005|volume = 14|issue = 12|date = December 1, 2005}}</ref>

The National Cancer Institute has argued that through careful bias correction, some of the limitations of FFQs can be overcome, and they can be very useful.<ref name=nci-principles>{{cite web|title=Principles and recommendations from NCI|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/approach/principles.html|publisher=[[NIH]]|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref>
