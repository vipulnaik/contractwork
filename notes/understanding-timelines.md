These are old notes from October 2019, dumped here for the record.

* Niche timelines (EA/rationalist)

* Tech company timelines

* General-human-interest timelines

Kinds of purposes:

* Our own consumption (e.g., for Vipul to read, or build upon)

* Mass market consumption (here, we are judging the usefulness of the timelines partly by the amount of traffic they draw)

Interaction between these:

* Niche timelines are mostly for our own consumption. We don't care
  about pageviews of these directly (or rather, the pageviews are so
  low that they aren't helpful in prioritization)

* Tech company timelines are mostly for mass market consumption. This
  means we should focus on the timelines that are getting nontrivial
  levels of traffic, or that we expect will get such levels of traffic

* General-human-interest timelines are a mix: their initial purpose is
  our own consumption. But we expect that at least some of them will
  also get more pageviews. Many general-human-interest timelines might
  also be helpful for EA/rationalist investigations, while also having
  broader implications.
