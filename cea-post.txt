When co-blogger Chris Hendrix <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-intro/">started off</a> a series a couple of years on the origins of immigration restrictions, he <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-the-origins-of-immigration-restrictions-the-chinese-exclusion-act/">fittingly began</a> with the Chinese Exclusion Act, looking at the arguments made for the act at the time. He looked at both the evidence available at the time and the evidence that has emerged since then, and examined the arguments made in light of that evidence. In a subsequent post in the series, I took a brief look at the <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/how-did-we-get-here-chinese-exclusion-act-implementation-1882-1910/">early years of the implementation of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882-1910)</a>. While both these posts examined some aspects of the Chinese Exclusion Act in some detail, there is a lot about the history and aftermath of the Act that went unexplored.

Recently, I had the opportunity to create a number of Wikipedia pages on topics related to the Chinese Exclusion Act: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chae_Chan_Ping_v._United_States">Chae Chan Ping v. United States</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angell_Treaty_of_1880">Angell Treaty of 1880</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chy_Lung_v._Freeman">Chy Lung v. Freeman</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fong_Yue_Ting_v._United_States">Fong Yue Ting v. United States</a>, and others. As I worked on these pages, I familiarized myself more with the situation surrounding the Chinese Exclusion Act. I became more convinced that a more in-depth look at the Chinese Exclusion Act would help shed light on the modern border control regime.

I therefore intend to do at least three more posts on the subject. The current post will focus on the key developments and tug-of-wars that occurred until about 1872 (with passing mentions of trends that would continue into the late 1870s). A later post will discuss the more eventful years starting 1873. The year 1873 was marked by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873">Panic of 1873</a>, the beginning of an economic downturn in the United States. The economic downturn was likely a contributing factor to increased anti-Chinese sentiment over the coming years, and key legislative and judicial developments related to immigration happened beginning 1875.

In particular, this post looks at the <a href="http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions">"keyhole solutions"</a> used by state and local law enforcement in California before the federal government got on board with significantly restricting immigration. I discuss many (tentative) lessons and questions for the feasibility of migration liberalization that arise from this analysis. This post also makes me more confident of observations I had made in my post on <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/south-south-migration-and-the-natural-state/">South-South migration and the natural state</a>.

A line of argument or rhetoric I find quite common among people I talk to who have studied United States immigration history is that the United States had virtually free migration until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and even then, migration restrictions only affected the Chinese. This is largely true, and was the topic of my first blog post for the site: <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/why-was-immigration-freer-in-19th-century-usa">"Why was immigration freer in 19th century USA?"</a> However, a study of history makes clear that the Chinese Exclusion Act was not the result of a sudden swing to restrictionism, but rather, a result of a gradual evolution both in public opinion and the political climate over several years. Writing the current post has also caused me to update my thinking on the question I posed on why immigration was freer in 19th century USA, but I will defer discussion of my revised thinking to future posts.

<h4>First, they came for the Chinese</h4>

John's post on <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/tearing-chestertons-fence-bigotry-border-controls/">tearing down Chesterton's fence</a> offers a good bird's eye view of how immigration restrictions originated worldwide. While researching the subject, I noticed that in at least two other English-descended countries (Canada and Australia) the first significant immigration regulations appear to have been explicitly targeted at the Chinese, as I noted in an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/openborders/permalink/913950588701663/">Open Borders Action Group post</a>.

The situation in Australia closely paralleled the situation in California. In both cases, large numbers of Chinese moved to the area around 1850 in search of gold. In both cases, resistance to Chinese started off with native miners and labor unions of "natives" (i.e., whites, rather than the indigenous population), but gradually spread to the rest of society. However, in the case of Australia, federal action on immigration occurred more quickly: the Immigration Restriction Act of 1855 imposed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_Australians#Immigration_Restriction_Act_.26_The_Walk_from_Robe">head tax on Chinese immigrants arriving at Victorian ports</a>. Although action was federal, the actual restriction on Chinese arrival was only applied to the ports that were attracting Chinese. This keyhole solution led to a keyhole response: Chinese started arriving at ports where the head tax was not enforced, and then walking from there to the mining areas. Wikipedia says:

<blockquote>The Royal Commission after the Eureka stockade also looked into the Chinese situation as another one of the miner's grievances. In 1855 the Victorian parliament passed the Immigration Restriction Act in an effort to restrict Chinese immigration. This forced Chinese arrivals in Victorian ports to pay a £10 head tax. It also mandated that there could only be a certain amount of Chinese travelers per tonnage of shipping. This put a dent in the ship masters coffers. Cost of passage was already high. This Act did appear to limit the numbers of Chinese arriving in Victorian ports. Official Victorian records show over 10,000 Chinese arriving in Victoria between 1853 and 1855 but only a few hundred in the next two years. However, numbers of Chinese on the Victorian goldfields continued to swell through overland routes. To avoid this Act, many ships travelled to South Australia. Between 1855 and 1857 thousands of Chinese landed in the Port of Adelaide and the port town of Robe, South Australia. In fact thanks to these migrants the town of Robe's population doubled overnight and it developed into the main port of call for Chinese arriving in Australia. It was then a long overland route to the Victorian goldfields.</blockquote>

This imperfect but still reasonably successful restriction on Chinese immigration would eventually be superseded by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, the act that marked the beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy">White Australia policy</a>. The chief difference between the cases of Australia and California appears to be that in the case of California, it took a couple decades between the point in time when there was state-level anti-Chinese sentiment to the point where there was sufficient political impetus for federal action.

The timeline of immigration regulation in Canada more closely matches that of <em>federal</em> immigration regulation in the United States. The first significant restriction on Chinese immigration to Canada was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Immigration_Act_of_1885">Chinese Immigration Act of 1885</a> that, like Australia's first attempt at restriction, imposed a head tax on Chinese migrants. The head tax was increased over time until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Immigration_Act,_1923">Chinese Immigration Act of 1923</a> that shut off immigration from China entirely. This is similar to the sequence of events in the United States: a Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that banned migration for Chinese laborers, followed with tightening and closing of loopholes over the next few decades.

Why did all three countries come for the Chinese first, before expanding to Asia, Africa, and less developed parts of Europe? To some extent, the similarity in the evolution of immigration regulation can be traced to the political decision-makers in various countries taking cues from one another. However, I think the dominant factor here is that the Chinese were a unique group of migrants that had each of these features:

<ul>
	<li>Large population in a country suffering from various forms of war and despotism (the waves of migration to California and Australia occurred around the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a>), and therefore, large numbers of migrants.</li>
	<li>Very distinct in language and customs from the "natives" of the countries (i.e., whites), more so than people from non-English European countries, or even compared to Mexicans.</li>
	<li>Clearly foreign to the land, having come to it in large numbers over a short period of time, either voluntarily or as indentured laborers of various sorts. This put them in contrast with indigenous people (the true natives!). It also marked them somewhat distinctly from the population of African descent in the United States that, although non-white, had a substantial proportion that was either slaves or descendants of people who had been brought over as slaves. While immigration of free people of African descent would eventually get people worried in the United States and Australia, this took some time.</li>
	<li>Factors that tended to make Chinese migrants more noticeably successful and therefore a bigger threat to whites in the receiving countries.</li>
</ul>

<h4>It began in California</h4>

1848 was an important year for California for two distinct reasons. First, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War">Mexican-American War</a> concluded in February of this year. California had, since 1821, been part of Mexico, and it was as part of the Mexican-American War that Alta California (the northern part of California) was acquired by the United States in 1847. The southern part of California, Baja California, is still a part of Mexico. At the beginning of the year, San Francisco had a population of about 1,000, barely enough to be called a city.

Second, 1848 marked the beginning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. Gold was discovered in California in January 1848. Initially, gold was so plentiful that mining it needed no special technology: early arrivals could simply retrieve gold by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_panning">panning</a>. As news of the discovery of gold spread, there was significant migration to California from the rest of the United States, other parts of Mexico, and China. As the low-hanging fruit started getting exhausted, it became harder and harder to make money off gold panning, and more sophisticated mining operations became necessary.

A lot has been written about the California Gold Rush, including <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/california-gold-rush/summary.html">its effect on how the American Dream is defined</a>, the role of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_California_Gold_Rush">women</a>, and its importance for the development of California and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_San_Francisco#1848_gold_rush">major cities</a>. Miners formed alliances and rivalries of various sorts. One significant way miners got classified was based on their year of arrival (those arriving in 1848 were called forty-eighters, and those arriving in 1849 were called forty-niners). Race/ethnicity also played an important role in the alliances that would form. Whites had a bit of an upper hand, and state force was used to expel Native Americans (indigenous people) as well as the Mexican and Chinese miners.

The common narrative of immigration as strangers coming to an area where natives have been around for a while thus fails to describe the situation in California in many many ways:

<ul>
	<li>California was not even a part of the United States for that long before the first wave of Chinese migration. It was part of Mexico.</li>
	<li>If anybody could claim true native status, it was the indigenous Native Americans. They were, however, not treated well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/chinhate.html">As a matter of pure geography</a>, at that time, the journey from China to California took less time than the journey from the eastern United States (this was before the development of rapid transport across the United States).</li>
	<li>The vast majority of immigrants to California were Americans, and for urban centers such as California, the population of natives that existed prior to 1848 was negligible.</li>
</ul>

According to <a href="http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist6/chinhate.html">this source</a>, the initial attitude to the Chinese as a whole (excluding the issue of competition between miners) was positive. Quoting from it:

<blockquote>If the social conditions prevailing in California in the days of ’49 are recalled, it is not difficult to realize how welcome were the Chinese who first came to the country. Here were men who would do the drudgery of life at a reasonable wage when every other man had but one idea—to work at the mines for gold. Here were cooks, laundrymen, and servants ready and willing. Just what early California civilization most wanted these men could and would supply.

The result was that the Chinaman was welcomed; he was considered quite indispensable. He was in demand as a laborer, as a carpenter, as a cook; the restaurants which he established were well patronized; his agricultural endeavors in draining and tilling the rich tule lands were praised. Governor McDougal referred to him as “one of the most worthy of our newly adopted citizens.” In public functions he was given a place of honor, for the Californians of those days appreciated the touch of color which he gave to the life of the country. The Chinese took a prominent part in the parades in celebration of the admission of the state to the Union. The Alta California, a San Francisco newspaper, went so far as to say, “The China Boys will yet vote at the same polls, study at the same schools, and bow at the same altar as our countrymen.” Their cleanliness, unobtrusiveness and industry were everywhere praised.</blockquote>

However, as the low-hanging fruit in mining operations was plucked, life became more challenging, with many people who had come hoping to (literally) strike gold making much less than they had anticipated. In the 1860s, work on transcontinental railroads began, and Chinese were recruited in large numbers for this work, with their journeys financed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit-ticket_system">credit-ticket system</a>. A number of laws were passed in California attempting to curtail and tax activities by the Chinese.

<ul>
	<li>1850: The <a href="http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/506-foreign-miner-taxes.html">Foreign Miners' Tax</a> was imposed on Chinese and Mexican miners. This "keyhole solution" addressed only the issue of Chinese competition in mining, without trying to broadly prevent Chinese from living in California or participating in other professions (where their presence was still appreciated at the time).</li>
	<li>1854: In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Hall">People v. Hall</a>, the California Supreme Court established that Chinese citizens had no rigts to testify against white citizens. The ruling was an extension of th e California Criminal Procedure's (1850) exclusion: "No black or mulatto person, or India, shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of, or against a white man." The ruling provided significant <em>de facto</em> protection to violence by whites against Chinese (although it was still possible for a white person to testify to another white person killing a Chinese). In the years leading up to the Act, violence against the Chinese, as well as the framing of Chinese for violence when the real culprit was unknown, had been <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_chinese.html">on the rise</a>. The Court decision provided <em>de facto</em> legal protection to such violence.</li>
	<li>1855: The California state legislature passed an <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nas3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA194&lpg=PA194&dq=An+Act+to+Discourage+the+Immigration+to+this+State+of+Persons+Who+Cannot+Become+Citizens+Thereof&source=bl&ots=p0Op_Za5dD&sig=iJdjo3bYFISPIInsrEh0VlDtTcI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_JApT8bKOeWtsAKqzqXiAg#v=onepage&q=An%20Act%20to%20Discourage%20the%20Immigration%20to%20this%20State%20of%20Persons%20Who%20Cannot%20Become%20Citizens%20Thereof&f=false">act to Discourage the Immigration to this State of Persons who cannot become Citizens thereof</a>.</li>
	<li>1862: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Coolie_Act">Anti-Coolie Act</a> was passed. While the Foreign Miners' Tax focused only on mining, the Anti-Coolie Act applied to anyone of Chinese origin applying for a license for any kind of business. This broadening of scope reflected the increased diversification of the California economy and the desire to minimize Chinese competition in various industries.</li>
</ul>

Why was the ramp-up to punitive unwelcome for Chinese in California gradual, rather than immediate?

<ul>
	<li>The initial efforts <em>were</em> of a keyhole nature because the people of the state of California, and their elected representatives, did not want to end Chinese immigration entirely. They only wanted to end competition from Chinese in specific domains. For instance, the initial focus was on ending competition from the Chinese in mining, while the presence of the Chinese in city services was initially welcomed. It was only after the economy diversified more that anti-Chinese sentiment spread beyond miners.</li>
	<li>In general, it takes time for sentiments against a group to reach enough of a threshold for punitive restrictions against the group to acquire political traction. As discussed in the next list, some of the concerns that ultimately led to Chinese exclusion would take decades to be widely considered by the public as problems.</li>
	<li>Taxes on Chinese, in addition to dissuading them somewhat, also created cash cows for governments. This made governments reluctant to completely ban Chinese from entering or working.</li>
	<li>Legislators might have overestimated the deterrent effect of initial measures, or the extent to which these measures would placate the general public. It was only after it became clear that these measures were insufficient in placating anti-Chinese sentiment that the ante was upped.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lack of federal support for restrictions (in the 1850s and 1860s)</h4>

It's worth noting that even as anti-Chinese sentiment was gaining traction in California, the United States federal government did not endorse the sentiment. To the contrary, freedom of movement continued to be a theme of treaties between the United States and China.

In 1858, with the conclusion of the first half of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Opium_War">Second Opium War</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tientsin">Treaty of Tientsin</a> was signed between China, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. This complicated treaty required Chinese ports to open up to foreigners and allowed Christian missionary activity in China. While the treaty was widely regarded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_Treaties_%28China%29">"unequal"</a> (i.e., against China), it still didn't make sense to close these countries to migration from China. (Interestingly, the failure to close to migration also drove unhappiness in Australia, which was under the rule of the United Kingdom). In 1868, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlingame_Treaty">Burlingame Treaty</a>, a bilateral treaty between the United States and China, established formal friendly relations between the countries, enshrining most favored nation status for trade as well as freedom of movement, while noting that citizens of either country would not be eligible for citizenship in the other. This is consistent with <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/oh-the-absurdity-of-thinking-that-open-borders-demands-open-citizenship/">separating open borders from open citizenship</a>, a theme we have discussed on the blog in the past.

<h4>Changes in the 1860s: the Transcontinental Railroad and the Civil War</h4>

As I noted earlier, when the California Gold Rush began, the journey from the Chinese ports to California took less time than traveling across the United States. The huge time and cost of land travel was a major factor in keeping California and the United States federal government somewhat insulated from one another. Thus, even as public pressure mounted in California to put an end to Chinese immigration, there was no similar agitation at the federal level. Chinese in California weren't spreading too far and wide to the rest of the United States, and people in the Central and Eastern United Sttates anyway didn't have much to do with California.

Connectivity in the United States changed greatly in the 1860s with the building of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>, that ran all the way from the San Francisco Bay Area (specifically, from Sacramento) to Iowa (specifically, Council Bluffs), where it connected with the existing rail network in the Eastern United States. As mentioned above, migrants from China played a key role in building the western part of the railroad, known as the Central Pacific Route. The eastern part of the route, known as the Union Pacific Route, was built largely by Irish immigrants (another immigrant group that would receive a lot of negative attention in the coming decades). The two teams raced toward each other and met at Promontory, Utah. With the opening of the railroad for operation in 1869, the cost of transportation across the United States dropped from $1000 to $150 according to <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/inventions/transcontinental-railroad">history.com</a>. 

The building of this railroad allowed for both people and goods to move. In particular, it became easier for both migrants and natives to move to other parts of the country. One immediate consequence of this increased mobility was the movement of large numbers of Chinese to New York City, the place that, to this day, has the largest concentration of ethnic Chinese outside China. As <a href="http://www.ny.com/articles/chinatown.html">ny.com says</a>:

<blockquote>New York City's Chinatown, the largest Chinatown in the United States and the site of the largest concentration of Chinese in the western hemisphere is located on the lower east side of Manhattan. Its two square miles are loosely bounded by Kenmore and Delancey streets on the north, East and Worth streets on the south, Allen street on the east, and Broadway on the west. With a population estimated between 70,000 and 150,000, Chinatown is the favored destination point for Chinese immigrants, though in recent years the neighborhood has also become home to Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Burmese, Vietnamese, and Filipinos among others.

[...]

As the gold mines began yielding less and the railroad neared completion, the broad availability of cheap and willing Chinese labor in such industries as cigar-rolling and textiles became a source of tension for white laborers, who thought that the Chinese were coming to take their jobs and threaten their livelihoods. Mob violence and rampant discrimination in the west drove the Chinese east into larger cities, where job opportunities were more open and they could more easily blend into the already diverse population. By 1880, the burgeoning enclave in the Five Points slums on the south east side of New York was home to between 200 and 1,100 Chinese. A few members of a group of Chinese illegally smuggled into New Jersey in the late 1870s to work in a hand laundry soon made the move to New York, sparking an explosion of Chinese hand laundries.</blockquote>

The other side of the coin was increased native mobility: people in the Eastern United States could now move to California easily, and what was happening in California became a question of greater national significance. There were now political incentives for federal action against Chinese immigration.

Another change that was not very directly related to the Chinese, but still potentially significant for understanding the evolving moral and legislative framework, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">American Civil War</a> (concluded 1868). The Confederate South was not a directly important player in the debate on restricting Chinese immigration.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870">Naturalization Act of 1870</a> extended the ability to naturalize from free white persons to now also include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent". At the time, there was very little voluntary migration from Africa (compared to migration from China and Europe) so the people affected by the Act were primarily former slaves and their descendants. For the purpose of immigration law, one significance of these moves was to shift United States government views (legislative, executive, and judicial) in a more <a href="http://openborders.info/territorialism">"territorialist"</a> direction. In other words, there was a greater recognition of the idea of fair and equal legal treatment, due process, and constitutional protections for all people within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. But this did not preclude the idea of restricting the entry of people into the territory, and, it would later turn out to be insufficient to act as a legal bulwark against deportations.

<h4>The 1870s: federal restrictionism in beta</h4>

Involved parties: federal government, California state government, Chinese, "natives", local courts, Supreme Court

Immigration restrictions? Still largely untested and speculative. But no clear articulation of a basis for rejecting them.

There were a few factors where legitimate truths mixed with inaccurate inference to cast the Chinese in a bad light. Not all of these kicked in at the outset. Some took years or even decades to become widely recognized public concerns.

<ul>
	<li>One of the perverse effects of the California Gold Rush was that it attracted a disproportionate share of men relative to women. This was true of all the races and ethnicities that moved at the outset, but the gap was closed for whites over time as movement within the United States became easier. However, the gap for Chinese was great, leading to a small share of Chinese women and an <a href="<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_chinese.html">even smaller share of Chinese women who were not prostitutes</a>. The solution attempted by the state of California was to deny entry to Chinese women suspected of being prostitutes, though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chy_Lung_v._Freeman">Chy Lung v. Freeman</a> overturned this. However, the federal government passed a similar restriction, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875>Page Act of 1875</a>. Of course, this restriction only worsened the gender imbalance, leading to a vicious cycle.</li>
	<li>The Chinese Six Companies, that would later morph into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Consolidated_Benevolent_Association">Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association</a>, played an important role connecting workers to businesses in need of them, providing social services to Chinese, engaging in political advocacy. In this respect, they played roles similar to civic organizations and political advocacy organizations. However, because of their importance as middlemen between contract workers and businesses, a perception began forming that Chinese were indentured laborers who were simply puppets of these companies. This perception, based on a grain of truth, was grossly exaggerated, feeding into the myth of foreigners as exploited indentured workers (myths whose analogues exist to this day, <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html">even for skilled H-1B workers today</a>). Henry Kittredge Norton describes it thus:

<blockquote>The Chinese who came to California were largely of this class and so described themselves on their arrival. It did not take long for the anti-Chinese agitators to define a “coolie” as a contract laborer and to describe how he was bound to a master in China to work a certain number of years at a small wage and how this terrible system was eating the very vitals out of American labor. This American labor about which there was so much concern was almost wholly composed of Irish and other European aliens who were no more American than the Chinese. But they had a vote in prospect. The Chinese did not.

While the success of the coolie fiction was largely due to the fact that there were so many who wanted to believe it, a number of circumstances combined to give it greater vitality. Most of the business transactions of the Chinese were done through their benevolent organizations which came to be locally known as the “Six Companies.” The Companies often contracted for large bodies of laborers and this fact led the unthinking to conclude that these laborers were under contract with the Six Companies to work for them as they should direct. This was not the true situation. These Companies simply acted as clearing-houses for all sorts of transactions among the Chinese, as they had found that they could handle things in a strange land more satisfactorily through such associations than they could individually.</blockquote></li>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit-ticket_system">credit-ticket system</a>, where a person's travel to the United States would be paid for by a lender in exchange for a share of the person's wages for the first few months of work was, somewhat inaccurately, cast in terms of indentured servitude. This system was particularly important for recruiting Chinese to come and work on the transcontinental railroads in the 1860s, and fed into the perception of the Chinese as mindless servants. Quoting again from the link above:

<blockquote>Another thing which strengthened the coolie fiction was the manner in which the Chinese were employed on the construction work. of the Central Pacific Railroad. Because of the scarcity of labor the men in charge of this construction work had sent an agent to China to secure Chinese laborers. In order to get these men over to this country, it was necessary to advance their passage-money and other expenses. To cover this loan each Chinaman so employed signed a promissory note for $75. This note provided for monthly instalment payments running over a period of seven months and was endorsed by friends in China. Each laborer was guaranteed a wage of $35 a month. This financial arrangement was of course seized upon and made much of by the anti-Chinese agitators as the final proof of “coolieism.”

The belief that the Chinese were contract laborers was one of those unfortunate errors which sometimes became current in our civic life, and by frequent repetition receive almost universal acceptance. In the present instance this phantom of Chinese slavery became so thoroughly a part of the political life of the Pacific Coast that no attempt was made to reach the truth of the matter. Every man in public life was under so binding a necessity to accept the popular belief in regard to the Chinese and to truckle to it at every turn, that for one to seek the real truth of the matter was to end forthwith his political career.</blockquote></li>
</ul>

On the whole, looking at the nature of these complaints, I am reminded of a paragraph from Bryan Caplan's post <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/06/misanthropy_by.html">Misanthropy by Numbers</a>, that he quotes in <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/12/krikorian_again.html">Assimilation and Immigration Restriction</a>:

<blockquote>The ideal approach, though, is to twist positives into negatives.  If the maligned group is hard-working, call them "coolies" or "helots."  If they're respectful, call them "slavish" or "docile."  If they're frugal, call them "greedy" or "cheap."  If they raise property values, say "They're making housing unaffordable."  This makes lazy listeners feel like you've covered all your bases, and deprives your opponents of their best arguments.</blockquote>
