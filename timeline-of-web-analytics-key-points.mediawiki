== Web links to look at ==

http://blog.measureful.com/2014/02/the-evolution-of-google-analytics-a-timeline/

https://www.clicktale.com/academy/blog/a-brief-history-of-web-analytics/ (see also references): This is particularly good for the pre-Google Analytics part.

== Kinds of tracking ==

=== Website-based ===

* First-party server logs, triggered through any web request regardless of whether the client can execute JavaScript.

* Image-load (pixel) tracking in the raw HTML; this could load from the first-party site or a third-party site, and does not need any JavaScript execution capability (but still needs a browser that automaticaly fetches images).

* Third-party beacons (small snippets of code that load a third-party JS). Basic mechanism: a few lines of code in the raw HTML loads a JS file that executes various logic around tracking pageviews, user actions, etc. and sends them to the third-party server (API endpoint), usually receiving a pixel in response for confirmation. Work only for JavaScript-executing user agents.

** Those that use only first-party cookies (cookies still stored under main domain, not third-party site) and cannot connect user activity across sites

** Those that use third-party cookies (cookies stored under third-party site) and can therefore connect user activity across sites

* Downstream logs, e.g., logs generated by specific actions such as purchases

=== User-based ===

* Browser toolbars, i.e., tracking tied to the user (rather than to the website) that users install (sometimes without full understanding of what they're installing). Used by Alexa, Quantcast, Google Toolbar (but not related to Google Analytics)

== Events ==

* Launch of Alexa, Compete, Quantcast, etc. and their audience panel approach (through browser toolbars) for user-level tracking

* Apache or whatever for web logs, log analysis softwares for that? (late 1990s/early 2000s?); see https://www.clicktale.com/academy/blog/a-brief-history-of-web-analytics/ for one version of the story

* Growth of JavaScript in browsers, leading to JavaScript-based third-party tracking pixels (what was the first?)

* Launch of Urchin (the original thing that became GA) and its initial feature set

* Google acquires Urchin, makes it Google Analytics, and makes it free for all

* Launch of website beacons by each of these services (for website-based tracking):

** Clicky Web Analytics
** Sitemeter
** Chartbeat
** Heap Analytics
** Alexa Certified Metrics (third-party cookie focus)
** Quantcast Measure (third-party cookie focus)

* Mobile web growth, effect on tracking if any

* Mobile apps, app analytics solutions

* Facebook launches retargeting pixels for audience analytics/targeting

* Use of UTM tags and other URL parameter and rewriting tricks to identify traffic source.
** Huge death toll of UTM tags when people use it to track internal link performance, see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6205762?hl=en

== Measurement issues ==

=== Legitimate users not getting tracked ===

* Ad blockers and malware detectors/cleaners and their effect on analytics/tracking. Google Analytics and other trackers listed on EasyList Plus, blocked by uBlock; third-party cookie trackers listed on EasyList

* Any trends related to NoJS browsing?

=== Bot and spam problems ===

* Bot traffic
** Bots start executing JavaScript
** Lots of spam referrers etc. pollute Google Analytics data through a few different mechanisms

=== Sampling issues ===

* Google Analytics begins (?) sampling for large websites, limiting to 250K sessions

* Google Analytics Pro release, to allow unsampled data up to 10M sessions

=== Cache loading ===

Pages loaded entirely from cache. JS trackers still work but web request logs don't.

* History of caching/CDNs and effect on metricing.

== Changes to user details available ==

(I'm excluding launches of brand new analytics services here)

* Any changes to standards re: what to include in HTTP headers?

* Use of proxies:
** Rise and fall of VPNs
** Rise and fall of Tor-like services
** Growth of mainstream things like Amazon Silk and Opera Mini where web requests are made server-side

* Google Analytics gives website opt-in ability to join with DoubleClick cookie and infer gender, age, and interests data for users

* Increasing use of HTTPS and URL shorteners on the web makes referrers hard to track. Specifically the case for:
** Search traffic (no longer know search query)
** Social media traffic

* Google Analytics integrates with Google Webmaster Tools to get Google search impression and click data for searches leading to the site.

== Other changes to Google Analytics ==

* Google Analytics launches ability to send custom events

* Google Analytics launches A/B testing abilities

* Google Analytics change to Universal Tracking

* Google Analytics switches to new Analytics dashboard format

* Google Analytics starts showing realtime data; believed to be
  response to competition from Chartbeat

* Release of Google Surveys, incorporation into Google Analytics,
  Google Surveys is free when surveying about own site

== Other things ==

Use judgment on what and how much to include.

=== Email analytics ===

* Pixel tracking for measuring email opens, URL redirects for email clicks

* Names of major email analytics services or mass mail services and analytics tools

=== Analytics-cum-social media management ===

* HubSpot

=== Website A/B testing tools ===

Kinda like analytics

* Optimizely

* MixPanel

* Apptimize

=== Backend analytics ===

* Loggly?

* Load balancer analytics and diagnostic tools

* Akamai, CloudFlare etc. provide DDoS protection, overall web analytics, anomaly detection

=== Optimization tools ===

Taboola, Outbrain etc that show recommendations

=== Offline metric integration ===

* Integrations of GA or other things with sending offline conversion data?

* Google incorporates store check-in data, uses to display popular times
