<p>The portal also lists some other contract work managed or coordinated by Vipul Naik but funded by others. Examples of such contract work are work for <a href="/payer.php?payer=Peter+Hurford">Peter Hurford (starting May 2017)</a> and <a href="/payer.php?payer=Alex+Flint">Alex Flint (starting March 2018)</a>. It also includes some other contract work that Vipul Naik's workers do for others, so that the workers have a more complete picture of all their contract work in the portal. An example is the work done by Issa Rice for <a href="/payer.php?payer=Berkeley+Existential+Risk+Initiative">Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI)</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few private payments that are reflected in the totals but not shown publicly as individual payments in either the portal or the git repository. These account for less than $300 in total payments. The affected workers have none of their payments publicly disclosed. In other words, any worker will either have all their payments publicly disclosed, or none.</p>
<p><strong>Starting March 8, 2017, all aspects of contract work that involve editing Wikipedia have been terminated.</strong> Prior to this, Vipul Naik received no third-party payment to finance the contract work, and in particular, the Wikipedia portion of it. The termination is due to the contract work coming under scrutiny at Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&oldid=769384347">Conflict of interest/Noticeboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#Vipul.27s_paid_editing_enterprise">Adminstrators' Noticeboard/Incidents</a>. If you have questions, please get in touch with Vipul Naik.</p>
