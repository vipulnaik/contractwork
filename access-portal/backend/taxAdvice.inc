For self-employed individuals with small enough self-employment income, it should work out to be in the ballpark of the "half of self-employment tax" that you entered in Form 1040 Schedule SE line 13. The values may not match up exactly due to the use of tax tables rather than schedules for tax calculation, as well as other adjustments, but they should be within a few dollars of each other. As income goes up, the earned income credit becomes smaller, and at sufficiently high incomes, it becomes zero. You can also cross-check your calculations by looking up the EIC table section in the Form 1040 tax tables (HTML or PDF) for your year; however, make sure to subtract the 1/2 of self-employment tax from your self-employment income when plugging into the table to calculate.</p>';

If you are owed a refund, you can either ask for it right away or have it apply to next year's taxes. If you owe money, there is a possibility that you may also need to pay an estimated tax penalty, but if you aren't sure how to calculate this penalty, you can leave it blank and let the IRS reach out to you if they need you to pay a penalty.</p>";
