The Internet has given us unprecedented tools to track metrics about topics ranging from pop culture to politics to sports to technology. This page describes different methods of measuring how much a topic is being talked about online, along with ways to interpret these numbers for offline use.

Although the page covers different, mutually independent, methods, each of these methods is noisy and unreliable in different ways. Therefore, it is better to use multipe methods where applicable, and then combine the evidence gathered from those methods. This is based on the idea of combining many weak lines of evidence rather than relying on one strong line of evidence.<ref>[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/ Many Weak Arguments vs. One Relatively Strong Argument], Jonah Sinick, ''LessWrong''</ref>

== Steps ==
=== Facebook page ===
#Identify a canonical (preferably official) Facebook page associated with the topic where applicable.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 1.jpg|center]]
#* Entities that correspond to living persons or active brands, companies or other kinds of organizations are likely to have official pages. For an official page, you'll see a blue check mark (specifically, white checkmark with a blue background)at the end of the name.<ref name=facebook-verified-profile>[https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892 Verified Page or profile], Facebook</ref> Currently active large companies are highly likely to have official pages. Among individuals, currently living celebrities in movies and music are highly likely to have official pages. Examples among musicians include Taylor Swift<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift/ Taylor Swift official page on Facebook]</ref> and Rihanna.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/rihanna/ Rihanna official page on Facebook]</ref> Examples of companies include Google<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/Google/ Google official page on Facebook]</ref> and Coca-Cola.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/CocaColaUnitedStates/ Coca-Cola (United States) official page on Facebook]</ref>
#* Some famous people do not have official pages, but they do have verified ''personal'' profiles. This is just their usual Facebook account, that is capable of getting friends and followers but not likes (note that not everybody allows people to follow them).<ref name=facebook-allow-following>[https://www.facebook.com/help/201148673283205 How can I let people follow me?], Facebook</ref> Examples include journalists such as Nicholas Kristof<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/kristof Nicholas Kristof personal profile on Facebook]</ref> and Evelyn Rusli<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/rusli Evelyn Rusli personal profile on Facebook]</ref> or technology sector leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/zuck Mark Zuckerberg personal profile on Facebook]</ref>, Sheryl Sandberg, and Marissa Mayer.<ref name=marissa-mayer>[https://www.facebook.com/marissamayer Marissa Mayer personal profile on Facebook]</ref>
#* Many topics are likely to have other forms of presence on Facebook: unofficial pages (usually created by fans), community pages (created automatically by Facebook based on the Wikipedia page), and discussion groups.
#In the case of official pages, identify relevant metrics including:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 2.jpg|center]]
#* Number of page likes. The current value, as well as the changes in the past two weeks, can be accessed by appending a "/likes" to the page URL, or equivalently, selecting the "Likes" option among the various options in the top panel to the right of the page photo. The "Likes" option may be hidden under "More" if the page has additional panel options.<ref>For instance, Taylor Swift's likes page is [https://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift/likes https://www.facebook.com/TaylorSwift/likes]</ref>
#* Number of people "talking about this". This can be accessed on the same page as the number of page likes. <ref name=adweek-ptat>[http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/people-talking-about-this-defined/273447 ‘People Talking About This’ defined], Brittany Darwell, ''AdWeek'', January 10, 2012</ref>
#* Number of likes for (and other reactions to) recent posts on the page.
#* Nature of comments and quality of the comments.
#* Number of page likes from your friends.
#* Some samples of users who like the page. You can look both at samples among your friends (about whom you might know more, and therefore get a richer sense of who is interested in the page) as well as in the general audience, including people who like specific posts.
#Compare the metrics for the page with metrics for pages of competing entities, to put it in better context. For instance, to evaluate Katy Perry, it makes sense to compare with contemporaries such as Taylor Swift or Shakira, but a direct comparison with Barack Obama doesn't make sense. You can even get Facebook to show you pages similar to a given page, by typing "Pages similar to Katy Perry" in the search bar. [[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 3.jpg|center]]
#Adjust for fake likes and shallow likes.
#*The problem of fake likes arises when a lot of bots like a given page. This can happen either due to the page buying likes (either intentionally buying bot likes, or doing so unintentionally while under the impression of buying legitimate likes). It can also arise because bots, in order to appear like genuine users, may like pages of various celebrities or important topics or brands. Therefore, this problem needs to be controlled for most if you think the page may have tried to buy likes, ''or'' if the topic is a major celebrity or brand.<ref name=socialdraft-fake-facebook>[http://socialdraft.com/how-to-identify-fake-likes-and-followers/ How To Check If a Brand Has Fake Likes and Followers]</ref>
#*The problem of "shallow likes" is related to the problem of fake likes. Shallow likes refer to cases where the users are real, legitimate humans using the site properly, but they are not genuinely interested in the topic. They may have liked the topic as a result of being shown a sponsored post, or in error. Whether shallow likes is a problem for your estimate of popularity depends on how you plan to use the estimate.
#*In many cases, fake likes and shallow likes may be hard to separate out. However, if the goal is to determine legitimate, engaged likes, then it's not necessary to separate fake and shallow likes.
#*Some strategies to detect and address shallow likes include: looking at the ratio of "people talking about this" to page likes, looking at the fraction of likes that are from your friends, looking at the quality of some sample likers, and examining engagement on individual posts (all of these were mentioned in Step 2). A further way of detecting fake likes is to look at the most popular week, city, and age group, and see if they make sense given the topic in question. In particular, if the most popular city is not one where the topic is known to be popular, and in particular if it is a low-income country such as Pakistan or Bangladesh that is unlikely to be the most popular, then the likes are likely to be fake.<ref>[http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2013/03/how-to-determine-if-a-facebook-business-page-has-fake-fans/ How to Determine if a Facebook Business Page has Fake Fans], Pam Moore</ref><ref name=socialdraft-fake-facebook/>
#Outside of, and in addition to, official pages, use the appropriate metrics that make sense.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 4.jpg|center]]
#* For verified personal profiles, use the number of followers rather than the number of likes (this may not always be possible since some people do not turn on the option on Facebook to allow people to follow them).<ref name=facebook-allow-following/><ref name=marissa-mayer/> In addition, use likes, comments, and shares on recent posts the same way as you would for a page.
#* In some cases, the number of non-official pages (including fan pages) about the topic on Facebook can also give an idea of the topic's popularity. Also, pages about subsidiary topics can also give an idea. For instance, in the case of a singer, the existence and popularity of Facebook pages about the singer's songs can be a valuable indicator of the singer's popularity.
#* When metrics of this kind are available in addition to official page metrics, they can offer a useful comparison point to identify if fake or shallow likes are likely to have caused a problem.

=== Wikipedia page ===
#Identify the canonical Wikipedia page for the topic in the language(s) of interest. For most topics that are reasonably popular, there will be an English Wikipedia page.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 5.jpg|center]]
#Get information on the number of pageviews of the canonical page. This could be done in many ways:
#* For pageviews from December 2007 to December 2015, use the [http://stats.grok.se stats.grok.se] tool to get the page view counts for the page by month and by day within each month. This tool ''only'' includes desktop pageviews and does ''not'' exclude bots.<ref name=sgs-about>[http://stats.grok.se/about Wikipedia article traffic statistics (stats.grok.se) about page]</ref>
#* For pageviews from July 2015 onward, you can use the Wikipedia pageviews API (either directly, or by graphing it on Wikipedia, or through Wikipedia Views as discussed below). You can get pageview counts for desktop, mobile-app, and mobile-web. You can also filter the user to user, bot, or spider.<ref name=wikipedia-pageviews-api-about>[https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_per_article_project_access_agent_article_granularity_start_end Wikimedia REST API]</ref>
#* To get combined data over all time, you can use Wikipedia Views (that uses stats.grok.se data till December 2015 and API data from January 2016 onward)<ref>[http://wikipediaviews.org/about/ Wikipedia Views: About]</ref> or Wikipedia Trends (that switched to using the API starting August 2015).<ref name=wikipediatrends-about>[http://www.wikipediatrends.com/FAQ.php Wikipedia Trends FAQ]</ref>
#Use other proxies for importance, including:[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 7.jpg|center]]
#* The number of pages that link to the page (click the "What links here" under Tools on the left sidebar of the Wikipedia page).
#* The length of the Wikipedia page.
#* The number of edits made to the page: Click the "View History" button on the top right to see the edit history.
#* The heat of debate in the corresponding Talk page.
#* The number of languages it's in (on the page in any language, you can see links in the left sidebar to versions in other languages).
#Compare with Wikipedia pages on topics in the same reference class. Do this for the steps above. For instance, Katy Perry might be compared to Shakira or Taylor Swift.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 8.jpg|center]]
# Correct for bots.
#* In particular, when looking at data using stats.grok.se (prior to data being available through the Wikipedia pageviews API) keep in mind that a lot of traffic could be coming from bots and spiders. For data before August 2015, the official estimate is that about 15% of traffic is from bots and spiders, and the proportion is greater for less trafficked pages. Unlike the case of social media, the goal of these bots is not to boost the status of pages being visited but simply to scrape information.
#* One way of determining the prevalence of bots is to look at pageviews API data and measure the number of pageviews by bots and spiders since this data became available, then extrapolate this to earlier times.

=== Google Search (and its competitors) ===
#Use [http://www.google.com/trends Google Trends] to compare the search volume for the topic with the search volume for other topics. Because of its design, Google Trends only gives relative numbers and cannot give absolute search volume, so it is best used to compare different pages in the same reference class.
#Use keyword research tools to get more in-depth data on search volume and comparison with similar terms. There are a number of keyword research tools, some of them available for free and others requiring a paid subscription. Paid services will generally do better on the long tail of items, whereas free services will usually be good enough for very popular queries.<ref name=ducttapemarketing>[https://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/keyword-tools/ 8 Alternatives to Google Keyword Tool], John Jantsch, Duct Tape Marketing</ref><ref>[http://pamorama.net/2014/01/04/10-keyword-research-tools/ 10 Great Alternatives to the Google Keyword Research Tool], Pam Dyer, Pamorama</ref>

=== Twitter page ===
#Search for the canonical (preferably official) Twitter page associated with the topic. As is the case with Facebook, canonical pages may not exist. Also, some celebrities maintain a personal as well as a media or company Twitter account, and it can be difficult deciding which one to use. Look for the account with the blue check mark (specifically, white check mark with a blue background) and with the larger number of followers. [[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 10.jpg|center]]
# In case of a canonical Twitter page, look at the number of followers, as well as the number of retweets and favorites of posts. Compare with competing topics. You can see the page's total number of followers at the top, and you can examine the number of retweets and favorites under any given tweet they've posted.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 11.jpg|center]]
#* Make corrections for the large number of fake followers on Twitter. Twitter has a fairly large problem of fake accounts, more so than Facebook, partly because Twitter, by design, does not focus on real identity and does not require a user to have only one account.<ref name=nytimes-bits-twitter-fake-celebrities>[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/researchers-call-out-twitter-celebrities-with-suspicious-followings/ Researchers Call Out Twitter Celebrities With Suspicious Followings]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlouis/2013/04/07/twitters-growing-spam-problem/#4acdbeb14a59 Twitter's Growing Spam Problem], Tristan Louis, ''Forbes'', April 7, 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2012/08/27/celebrities-with-the-most-allegedly-fake-twitter-followers/#3d4d3a65468a Celebrities With The Most (Allegedly) Fake Twitter Followers], John Greathouse, ''Forbes'', August 27, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/chereenzaki/2013/03/26/paying-for-followers-may-cost-you-a-job/#4d590ebc9942 Paying For Followers May Cost You A Job], Chereen Zaki, ''Forbes'', March 26, 2013</ref>
#* There are a few different online tools you can use to estimate the extent to which a Twitter account's followers are fake. The numbers are based on heuristics used by these websites and may not be accurate. One such tool, that allows you to enter any Twitter account, is Twitter Audit.<ref name=twitteraudit>[https://www.twitteraudit.com/ Twitter Audit]; examples are the [https://www.twitteraudit.com/HillaryClinton audit of Hillary Clinton] and the [https://www.twitteraudit.com/KatyPerry audit of Katy Perry]</ref><ref>[http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/blogs/550151/twitter-audit-check-how-many-fake-followers-you-have-on-instagram.html This Is How You Can Check Who's Buying Fake Followers On Twitter], Corinne Redfern, ''Marie Claire'', August 13, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-keep-your-twitter-following-authentic/ How to keep your Twitter following authentic. Fake followers hurt your credibility -- so clean up your follower list!], Sarah Jacobsson, ''CNET'', March 30, 2015</ref>
# For more broad topics (those not about a living individual or brand) use hashtags and search filters. 
#* You can type the words into Twitter's search bar and select to see either top tweets or all tweets. Scrolling through the list of tweets can give an idea of the frequency with which people reference the topic.

=== YouTube Channel ===
#Be aware that this method applies only for topics where video is a primary form of consumption. Musicians are good candidates for this method. Look for the official channel of the musician by searching for it within YouTube. If you can't find it easily, first look for the top result for one of the musician's more famous videos, then see the channel the video is under. A blue checkmark identifies the official channel (though not all YouTube channels have these checkmarks).[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 12.jpg|center]]
#Navigate to the videos tab inside the channel and sort videos by "Most Popular" to get a sense of how widely viewed the channel's videos are. You can also see the number of subscribers to the channel above the videos, in the subscribe button on the right.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 13.jpg|center]]
#Use SocialBlade and click Monthly Statistics. to track subscribers and video views over the past month.<ref>See [http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/szyzyg/monthly Scott Manley's monthly statistics] as an example</ref>

=== Website ===
#Identify whether the topic has a canonical website, and whether it makes sense to use website traffic as a proxy for the topic's popularity or importance. Tracking popularity of the website can be useful in cases where there is a canonical website that people go to in order to consume or engage with the topic. This is not the case for many topics.[[Image:Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online Step 15.jpg|center]]
#*For instance, [http://www.shakira.com Shakira's website] gets negligible traffic compared to her online fame, because people consume her products on video websites or by purchasing her music. In contrast, for an information website such as WikiHow, the primary mode of consumption is via accessing the website.
#Use tools such as Alexa Internet, Quantcast, SimilarWeb, and HypeStat to get an estimate of total traffic and global traffic rank.
#* You can see the statistics that Alexa has for a given website by typing the website's name in the bar at [http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo Alexa Internet], or appending the site URL with a URL structure of the form alexa.com/siteinfo/sitename (you can omit the leading www.).
#* Alexa estimates every website's global and country-wise traffic, as well as traffic rank. It does so using a panel of users for which it tracks the websites they visit.<ref>[https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/200449744-How-are-Alexa-s-traffic-rankings-determined- How are Alexa’s traffic rankings determined?], Alexa Internet</ref><ref>[http://www.alexa.com/about About], Alexa Internet</ref> Since the user sample is small relative to the total set of Internet users, Alexa can be unreliable for small sites, but it is more reliable for more highly trafficked sites.<ref>[https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/200461920-Are-there-known-biases-in-Alexa-s-traffic-data- Are there known biases in Alexa's traffic data?], Alexa Internet</ref><ref>[https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-is-Alexa-website-ranking How accurate is Alexa website ranking?]</ref> What Alexa does a good job of is giving a crude estimate of the global rank as well as the rank in a few top countries.
#* It is also possible for websites to sign up to have their metrics certified by Alexa Internet (here, the website allows Alexa to track users on the site and in exchange Alexa can present a more reliable estimate of the website's traffic and traffic rank). Certification costs the website some money, and information on whether the website is certified is presented along with its statistics.
#* Slightly less censored versions of Alexa data, as well as some other related estimates, are presented by HypeStat. To see information on a website in HypeStat, use the URL structure hypestat.com/domainname (you can leave out the www.).
#* If the website is quantified (i.e., its sends data to Quantcast), Quantcast maintains rich information on the site's total traffic volume as well as the demographics and other attributes of the traffic. For many websites, this data is available to the public, although some sites restrict access to the data. Whatever data is publicly available can be accessed using quantcast.com/domainname (the leading www. can be omitted). Quantified sites will have a checkmark (black with white background). Note that Quantcast tries to estimate the traffic volume even to websites that do not send data to Quantcast, but this data tends to be unreliable since it relies on a rather small panel of people who have Quantcast installed (this is similar to how Alexa works). Websites' main motivation for being quantified is that Quantcast data on demographics and traffic can be used to approach potential advertisers.<ref>[https://www.quantcast.com/help-center/faqs/ FAQs], Quantcast</ref>
#* Another that can be used is SimilarWeb (URL structure: similarweb.com/website/ followed by your domain name). There are detailed online comparisons of Alexa and SimilarWeb.<ref>[http://www.seperia.com/blog/competitive-intelligence-tool-reviews/similarweb-vs-alexa/ SimilarWeb vs Alexa – Competing on Competitive Intelligence]</ref>
#* Full lists of such tools, and their strengths and weaknesses, are covered in many online discussions.<ref>[https://moz.com/rand/traffic-prediction-accuracy-12-metrics-compete-alexa-similarweb/ The Traffic Prediction Accuracy of 12 Metrics from Compete, Alexa, SimilarWeb, & More], Rand Fishkin, ''Moz''</ref>

=== Instagram page ===

#Search for the official Instagram page associated with the topic. As is the case with Facebook and Twitter, Instagram pages may not exist.
# Look at the following metrics associated with the page.
#* Total number of followers of the page.
#* Number of likes and comments on recent photos posted on the page.
# Adjust for fake Instagram followers. As is the case with Facebook and Twitter, Instagram suffers from the issue of many fake bots.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shayla-r-price/big-business-buying-fake_b_6322362.html Big Business: Buying Fake Instagram Followers]</ref>
#* There are some online tools<ref>[http://www.followercheck.co/ Followers Check] is one. An example is [http://www.followercheck.co/taylorswift FollowerCheck's report on Taylor Swift]</ref> There are also various heuristics for identifying fake followers.<ref name=socialdraft-fake-facebook/>

=== Fan pages and websites ===
#Use this method in the right cases. It is most useful for fiction book series and TV series. Examples include the Harry Potter series, A Song of Ice and Fire (and the associated TV series, Game of Thrones), Breaking Bad, Gilmore Girls, and Star Trek. To begin with, identify the most prominent existing fan websites, including wikis, forums, and personally maintained websites by fans.
# Look for fan websites on Wikia. For instance, there is a [http://harrypotter.wikia.com Harry Potter Wiki], a [http://gilmoregirls.wikia.com Gilmore Girls Wiki], and a [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com Game of Thrones Wiki]. You might also be able to find wikis unaffiliated with Wikia but using the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, Wikia, WikiHow, and many other sites, so you should be able to locate corresponding metrics on those sites (an example is [http://awoiaf.westeros.org A Wiki of Ice and Fire], a wiki related to the book series that inspired the Game of Thrones TV series). Evaluate the reach of these by looking at:
#* Number of pages on the wiki.
#* Number of active contributors to the wiki.
#* Number of edits to the wiki.
#* Number of pageviews of the wiki.
# Look for Q&A websites. For broad topics, there are usually associated Stack Exchange websites.
# Look for subreddits.
#* The number of people who follow or subscribe to a subreddit is listed in the right column on the subreddit's page.
# Look for online rankings. Websites such as [http://www.ranker.com Ranker] include ranked lists of various kinds of items (ranging from characters in specific pieces of fiction to actors to books).

== Tips ==

* Keep in mind that different metrics have different meanings, and they may not align up. The celebrity with the most Facebook likes may not have the most YouTube views, or the most Twitter followers. Weigh all the metrics appropriately depending on your goals. For instance, if your goal is to determine what celebrity people are most curious to read about, Wikipedia page views are a better metric, whereas if your goal is to determine what celebrity people like to consume more of, YouTube views are a better metric.
* Differences in the metrics can reveal interesting qualitative information about celebrities. For instance, Shakira has more Facebook likes than Taylor Swift or Katy Perry, but her English Wikipedia page gets fewer views. This could be for many possible reasons. Here's a non-exhaustive list of possibilities: (a) much of Shakira's fan base is in non-English languages, (b) since Facebook likes are cumulative, and Shakira has been around longer, she may have accumulated more likes, (c) Taylor Swift and Katy Perry are more likely to be "in the news" for controversies, driving more views to their Wikipedia pages. These hypotheses can be tested by looking at relevant metrics (such as views on non-English Wikipedia pages and YouTube channel views).
